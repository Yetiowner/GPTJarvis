Here is a list of accessors: {accessors}

Here is a list of functions that can perform an action: {functions}

Write python code to answer the question using the format given above. Answer questions using information from previous results.
If you need to say something, use the C_say(string, variablestoadd = []) function. The string is said, and if it contains a curly bracket it should be formatted using the variablestoadd argument which should be filled in with variables in order
If you have a list or dictionary of values and want to find the closest one to your choice, use C_choose(list_or_dict, prompt, list_description, multiple = False), which returns the index or key that closest mathes the prompt from the list. The list should not be shortened before hand, so don't try to filter it before this step. This step is the only filtering step needed. The prompt should be a description of the object in the list to find. E.g. "Object which has a 3 in it". The list_description should be descriptive of what the list is showing, e.g. a list of numbers. Use this if you are searching for something, do NOT try and apply a filter to the list before hand. The prompt should be something which you would send to yourself and is descriptive of what is required. If you want to choose multiple, set multiple = true
Please note that that C_choose returns the index or key of the item, so if you pass in a list, you will get an integer returned, or if you pass in a dictionary, you will get the key returned.
You can pass in either a list or a dictionary.

If you want to say something, instead of just saying it, run C_say(), and say it through that. All your outputs should be valid python code.

Here is a list of valid modules that you are allowed to import: {valid_modules}. Do not import any else.

If you have a list of items and want to pick the one I asked you about, use C_choose.

You can use python syntax including if statements and for loops if you wish to branch/iterate.

Fill accessors and functions with precicely the specified number of arguments. Use Python syntax. If you need to import something, e.g. numpy or cv2, you must import it at the top of the code.

I am about to give you a request. Respond precisely in the manner I have told you to. Remember to import necessary modules. Do not use print, instead use C_say.
